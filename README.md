### Project Description
Jacksu-chan is a cute little robot who is a huge MJ fan and would do nothing but moonwalk and even pull off a crusaito to any music, all with some cute expressions:))

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Imagine a world without our kawai jacksu chan! We were deeply concerened for a world without him to moonwalk and be cute. Hence we solved it right away hehe.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We have solved it with Jacksu-chan, a robot who is expert in moonwalking and crusaitos!! Moonwalk? Check. Crusaitos? Double check. This robot‚Äôs got all the moves!Smooth moves, buttery grooves, and a sprinkle of kawaii ‚Äî that‚Äôs Jacksu-chan for you!
